# Kula_chapchap
More of a joke project if anything, but still one of my best projects nonetheless that utilizes local API where I have fetched data from the app mainb bundle  . It provide nice practise for me to learn MVC architect and dirtied my hands on the latest release Apple framework;SwiftUI. This is likely to prepare me for bigger projects.
This is a simple uberEat-like app. KulaChapChap is a Kiswahili (Kenyan's laungauge) word to mean eat faster faster;
